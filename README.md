What???

GATS (a.k.a. the Go-CLI Acceptance Test Suite) are a collection of integration tests for the Go-CLI. In general, these should all be passed on recent CF Releases, but not on the stable version of the CLI. We may be using these at any given time to test new features that haven't been released yet.
